messages

{msg/type :inc msg/topic [:my-counter]}

//may find something to handle the security for me
{:login [:username]}
->salt from server gets pushed back
{:login [:password]}
->hash login password with salt + different hash than server
->security goes md5(salt+pass) -> server (sha1 (:value))
-login screen gets pushed back

->server configures, then derives --order matters might be bad

{:play [:score]}
